# Facial Keypoints Detection Dataset Pipeline

This repository uses the facial-keypoints-detection-pipeline dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/facial-keypoints-detection) to build a data science pipeline: data loading, descriptive analysis, data preprocessing, data transformation, model tranining (model learning and validation).

This pipeline was built as a partial project to the Machine Learning course of the M.Sc. in Computer Scinece program at the Federal University of Pernambuco.

More info and description is available at the .ipynb notebook file.
